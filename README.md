# Titanic Survival Prediction with Machine Learning

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze and predict passenger survival on the Titanic using the Kaggle Titanic dataset. It includes implementations of various classification algorithms such as SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Na√Øve Bayes, Perceptron, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Linear SVC, and Decision Trees.

## Overview

The Kaggle Titanic dataset consists of information about over 2200 passengers and 12 features. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on these features.
